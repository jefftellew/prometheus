# prometheus
My final project for AP Computer Science (2016)

This is a tower defense game where the objective is to protect your crashed ship, the Prometheus, from invading enemy aliens until you can repair it

None of the art is mine and I take no credit for it
Most if not all of the enemies are from Kingsisle's Grub Guardian game.
Towers are from DeviantArt, based on Digital Extremes' Warframe.

If anyone wishes for their art to be removed from the game, contact me and I would be happy to do so (jefftellew@gmail.com)
